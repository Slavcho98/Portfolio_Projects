<h2 id="about-the-project">About the project</h2>

<description>
  This project is a modern web application built using the latest JavaScript (ES6) features, styled with Tailwind CSS, and developed using the Vite build tool for optimal performance. The application is structured following the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture, ensuring a clear separation of concerns and maintainability. Additionally, it utilizes Masonry.js for grid layouts and Swiper.js for touch-enabled sliders.
</description>

## Features

-   **Modern JavaScript (ES6+):** Utilizes ES6 features such as modules, arrow functions, classes, template literals, and more for cleaner and more efficient code.
-   **Tailwind CSS:** Styled with Tailwind CSS for rapid UI development and consistent design.
-   **Vite:** Leveraged Vite for fast and efficient development and build processes.
-   **MVC Architecture:** Organized codebase following the MVC pattern to separate data (Model), UI (View), and application logic (Controller).

To start the project, follow these steps:

1. Install dependencies if they are missing using npm:

-   Navigate to the **javascirpt-tailwind-vite-project** branch.
-   Run **npm init.**
-   Run **npm install.**

2.Navigate to the javascirpt-tailwind-vite-project branch.

-   Ensure you have Vite installed. If not, run: **npm install vite --save-dev.**
-   Then, start the development server with: **npm run dev.**


3. Run the Python server using the terminal:

-    Install Python on your computer.

-    Install Flask: **pip install Flask** or verify the version with **python -m flask --version.**

-    Install Flask-CORS: **pip install Flask-CORS.**

-    Navigate to the **javascirpt-tailwind-vite-project**

-    Navigate to the REST_API directory: **cd REST_API.**

-    Run the authenticator script in the terminal: **python authenticator.py.**

## Things to Improve in the Future

While the project is functional, there are several areas that can be improved in the future:

-   **Fix the layout bug:** Address the issue where the layout is not properly displayed when discussions are first created.
-   **Add functionality to delete comments:** Implement the ability for users to delete their comments, enhancing the interactivity of the application.

-   **Add more transitions and animations:** Enhance the user experience by incorporating more dynamic transitions and animations throughout the application.

-   **Better refactoring of the code:** Continuously refactor and optimize the codebase to improve maintainability, readability, and performance.

-   **Change profile picture for each user:** Allow users to upload and change their profile pictures, personalizing their profiles further.
